Improvements - 

1. Here I have used BDD approach , by which the Feature file functionality is easily understandable by anyone.

2. I have used Cucumber HTML Reporting , however as an improvement , Extent Reporting functionality Could also be used.

3. As a Value add - CI/CD tool Jenkins could also be used to create a pipeline to trigger the build by integrating Jenkins + GIT Repo
